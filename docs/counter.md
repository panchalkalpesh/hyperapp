# Counter

In this example we'll learn how to use [actions](/docs/actions.md) to update the state of your application.

```jsx
app({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  view: (state, actions) =>
    <main>
      <h1>
        {state.count}
      </h1>
      <button onclick={actions.sub} disabled={state.count <= 0}>ー</button>
      <button onclick={actions.add}>＋</button>
    </main>,
  actions: {
    sub: state => ({ count: state.count - 1 }),
    add: state => ({ count: state.count + 1 })
  }
})
```

The state consists of a single property: `count` which is initialized to 0.

```jsx
state: {
  count: 0
}
```

The view function receives the state as the first argument and uses it to display the current value of the counter inside an `<h1>` tag.

```jsx
<h1>{state.count}</h1>
```

The view also defines two buttons with `onclick` handlers attached to them. The handlers are available in the actions object that is passed to the view as the second argument.

```jsx
<button onclick={actions.sub} disabled={state.count <= 0}>-</button>
<button onclick={actions.add}>+</button>
```

The `disabled` attribute is dynamically toggled depending on the value of the counter. This prevents the decrement button from being clicked when the counter reaches zero.

```jsx
disabled={state.count <= 0}
```

Note that neither of the actions update the state directly, instead, they return a partial state.

```jsx
sub: state => ({ count: state.count - 1 }),
add: state => ({ count: state.count + 1 })
```

When the state is updated as a result of calling an action, the view function is called and the application is rendered again.
